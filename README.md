# Client Room Radio

This is the Mac OS X and iOS project for Client Room Radio.

# Build

Remember to initialise the submodules.

You install cocoapods and then install Client Room Radio's dependancies:

    pod install

You should then be able to open the workspace and build for OS X or iOS. The iOS scheme should run on iPhone and iPad.
